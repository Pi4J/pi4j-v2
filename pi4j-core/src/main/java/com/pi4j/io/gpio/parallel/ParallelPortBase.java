/**
 * Abstract base class for parallel port implementations.
 * <p>
 * This base class requires abstract methods to be implemented by its inheritors, while the equivalent
 * public implementations are declared final. The intention of this pattern is for the execution order of each
 * to be predictable and deterministic while reducing the possibility of implementing classes to alter core behaviour.
 * <p>
 * An alternative approach could be to declare this class as non-abstract, final, and for the abstract methods
 * to be provided via composition with an `Operations`-like implementation which is able to focus on a simplified
 * set of runtime responsibilities without having to also account for configuration aspects such as
 * {@link com.pi4j.provider.Provider} references and {@link com.pi4j.common.Identity}, whose implementations don't vary
 * significantly between {@link com.pi4j.io.IO} implementations.
